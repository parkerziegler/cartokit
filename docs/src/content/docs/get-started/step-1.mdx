<p class="text-xl text-gray-700 tracking-wide dark:text-gray-200">Use `cartokit` to quickly load and display vector geospatial data on an interactive map.</p>

Often, the first thing you'll want to do with `cartokit` is display some data. To load vector geospatial data into `cartokit`, click the <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="!inline"><line x1="12" y1="5" x2="12" y2="19" /><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"/></svg> button in the **Layers** panel. This will open the **Add Layer** modal.

`cartokit` allows you to load geospatial data from either an API endpoint or a file on disk. For this example, we'll load a GeoJSON file of US counties pre-joined with unemployment data from `cartokit`'s public data catalog. Enter the following url into the **Endpoint** field:

```
https://storage.googleapis.com/cartokit-datasets/us-counties-unemployment.json
```

<Aside>
  cartokit currently only supports loading [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) datasets. If you have data in another format, you'll need to convert it to GeoJSON before loading it into cartokit. We recommend using [MapShaper](https://mapshaper.org/) or [`ogr2ogr`](https://gdal.org/programs/ogr2ogr.html) for this purpose. Support for additional formats is planned for future releases.

Next, give the layer a display name, such as "Unemployment Rate", in the **Display Name** field. Finally, click the **Add** button to add the layer to the map.

That's it, we've successfully loaded our data into `cartokit`! But something else has also happened. If you click the **Open Editor** button, you'll see that `cartokit` has generated a Mapbox GL JS program for you.

This program, when executed, will reproduce the map on screen exactly. We'll see that in action in a bit; first, let's visualize our data.
