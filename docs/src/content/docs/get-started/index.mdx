<p class="text-xl text-gray-700 tracking-wide dark:text-gray-200">This step-by-step tutorial will help you get started with `cartokit`, a direct manipulation programming environment for building web maps.</p>

With `cartokit`, you can analyze, visualize, and style vector geospatial data using familiar interactions from design tools like Adobe Illustrator, Figma, Felt, and Mapbox Studio. Simultaneously, `cartokit` generates a [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides) program to reproduce the map exactly. Take the code to your text editor or computational notebook for further customization or deployment.

## Your first map

For this tutorial, we'll recreate [a choropleth map from D3's example gallery](https://observablehq.com/@d3/choropleth/2) visualizing the unemployment rate by county in the United States.

Choropleth maps are one of the most common forms of thematic mapping in newsrooms today, used to visualize everything from [election results](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/upshot/2020-election-map.html) to [gun violence](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/14/us/gun-homicides-map.html) to [carbon footprints](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/13/climate/climate-footprint-map-neighborhood.html). With choropleth maps, areas are shaded in proportion to the value of a variable (e.g., unemployment rate) being represented.

As you'll see in this tutorial, `cartokit` makes creating choropleth maps a breeze.
