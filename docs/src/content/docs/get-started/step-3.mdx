  `cartokit`'s **Properties Panel** provides flexible controls for fine-tuning
  the display of your data.

With our choropleth layer in place, let's style it to match the D3 map. This will be a five-step process.

<Steps>
  1. Remove the default **Stroke**. 2. Increase the **Fill Opacity** to 100%. 3.
  Adjust the **Color Scheme** to a sequential white-to-blue palette. 4. Increase
  the number of **Steps** to 9. 5. Use a **Manual** classification method to
  match the D3 map's breaks exactly.
</Steps>

Here's what that'll look like.

With these changes, we're 95% of the way there. As a final step, let's overlay state boundaries on top of our choropleth layer. Re-open the **Add Layer Modal** by clicking the <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="!inline"><line x1="12" y1="5" x2="12" y2="19" /><line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"/></svg> button in the **Layers** panel and enter the following url into the **Endpoint** field:

```

```

This layer is a redistribution of the [US Census Bureau's 2023 Cartographic Boundary Files](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.html). Give the layer a display name, such as "States", in the **Display Name** field, and click the **Add** button to add the layer to the map. Finally, click on a state to open the **Properties Panel** of the States layer, remove the layer's **Fill** and set its **Stroke** to white.

With that, we've arrived at a perfect replication of the original D3 map. Better yet, `cartokit` has been updating our program on every change, ensuring the code and the UI stay in sync. Let's get that code out of `cartokit` and running in our own development environment.
